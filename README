Simple ANSI terminal K-20 meter[1] for JACK[2].

Currently, the RMS calculation is instant-rise, 300ms fall, and is calculated
over the jack buffer. This needs fixing. Should(?) be 300ms rise and fall with
an appropriate (less arbitrary) window.

The peak is instant-rise and falls linearly at 26 dB / 3 sec.

The over count is the number of overs, where an over is a period of 3 or more
samples at 0dB FS or greater (JACK can have positive dB FS because it's
floating point; 0dB == 1.0).
